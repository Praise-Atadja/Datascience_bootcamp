## Project - Option 1: Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

####Instagram TV (IGTV) Metrics Analysis

###Introduction
This Python code sample demonstrates how to measure and visualize key metrics for Instagram TV (IGTV) over time. IGTV is an important feature on Instagram, and tracking metrics is crucial for understanding its success and identifying trends.

### 1. Import Required Libraries
The code begins by importing the necessary Python libraries.

### 2. Sample Data
Next, a sample dataset representing IGTV metrics over time is created. This dataset includes various metrics such as Views, Average Watch Time, Audience Retention, Engagement Rate, Follower Growth, and Revenue.

### 3. Create a DataFrame
The sample data is organized into a DataFrame using the pandas library.

### 4. Visualize Metrics
This is achieved using the matplotlib library to create a line chart. Metrics such as Views, Average Watch Time, Audience Retention, Engagement Rate, Follower Growth, and Revenue are plotted on the same chart to observe their trends over time.
